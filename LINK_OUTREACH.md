Subject: SelNexa Health — resource for telemedicine & AI in Africa

Hi [Name],

I'm Keith from SelNexa Health. We build AI-powered telemedicine and EHR tools for healthcare providers in Zimbabwe and across Africa. We recently published a practical guide on telemedicine implementation and a blog post about AI diagnostics that I think would be useful to your readers.

Would you consider linking to or sharing our article:
https://www.selnexahealth.com/blog/selnexa-telemedicine-zimbabwe.html

We're open to contributing a guest post tailored to your audience.

Thanks for considering — I can provide more details or a short write-up.

Best,
Keith Tafangombe
