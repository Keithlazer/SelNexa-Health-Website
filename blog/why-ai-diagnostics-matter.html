      <h1>Why AI Diagnostics Matter</h1>
      <p class="lead">Supporting clinicians with AI is not about replacing judgment — it’s about surfacing likely diagnoses and making care faster and safer.</p>

      <h2>Clinical decision support</h2>
      <p>AI can process imaging and pattern data quickly, highlight red flags, and suggest next steps for clinicians to consider.</p>

      <h2>Safeguards and human oversight</h2>
      <p>At SelNexa we design AI to recommend, not to decide — clinicians always make the final call.</p>

      <h2>Integration into workflows</h2>
      <p>Seamless integration with EHR and scheduling helps clinicians adopt AI without workflow disruption.</p>
