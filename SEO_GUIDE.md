SelNexa Health â€” SEO & Search Visibility Guide

1) Verify site in Google Search Console
- Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
- Add property: https://www.selnexahealth.com/
- Choose "URL prefix" or "Domain" verification. For GitHub Pages, TXT DNS record (Domain) is preferred; otherwise upload the HTML file or use the HTML tag method.
- After verification, submit sitemap: https://www.selnexahealth.com/sitemap.xml

2) Verify site in Bing Webmaster Tools
- https://www.bing.com/webmasters
- Add and verify the site and submit the sitemap.

3) Quick on-site checks
- Ensure the main pages have unique title/meta descriptions.
- Keep the h1 consistent and include brand name on the homepage.
- Ensure structured data (Organization, WebSite SearchAction) is present (already added to index.html).

4) Local and brand signals
- Create/claim a Google Business Profile for "SelNexa Health" if you have a physical address.
- Add consistent NAP (name, address, phone) across site and directories.

5) Content & backlinks
- Publish 2-4 authoritative articles targeting branded and non-branded queries:
  - "SelNexa Health telemedicine Zimbabwe"
  - "SelNexa Health AI diagnostics"
  - "SelNexa Health appointment booking"
- Reach out to partner sites, local healthcare directories, and industry blogs to request backlinks.

6) Monitoring
- Use Search Console's Performance report to track impressions & queries.
- Check "Coverage" for crawl/index issues.
- Re-submit sitemap after significant changes.

7) Advanced (optional)
- Add hreflang if you serve multiple locales.
- Implement server-side rendering for dynamic pages (if any) to improve crawlability.
- Use structured review snippets for testimonials or case studies (Review schema).

If you'd like, I can:
- Add meta tags to other pages (already applied to main pages).
- Create 2 starter blog posts optimized for brand + target keyword and add them to /blog/ with proper metadata.
- Draft outreach email templates for link building.
